# SCneighbours

Single-Cell Neighbourhood Exploration Tool

Note: The functions are using the nearest-neighbour graph from the RNA
assay (RNA_nn), PLEASE change to SCT_nn if you are using the SCT assay.

## Installation

library(devtools)

install_github(“<https://github.com/CSI-Doherty/SCneighbours>”)

## Technique 1: Visualization of Cell Neighbourhoods

For individual cells or cell groups, we visualize their cell
neighbourhoods as either dots or density contours on a dimensionality
reduction map, uncovering tightly interwoven or widely dispersed
regions.

This allows us to learn which clusters might need merging if they have
largely overlapped neighbourhoods, and infer trajectory relationships of
cells obscured by the reduction.

    source("visualize_neighbourhood_function.R")

    # example usage
    visualize_neighbourhood(seu, meta_data_column = "seurat_clusters", meta_data_highlight = "12", reduction = "umap", density = T)

## Technique 2: Quantification of Cell Neighbourhoods

For each cell, we quantify the distribution of its neighbouring cells by
the variance in their coordinates, providing insights into the cell
positioning in the reduction map.

Large variance indicates diminished confidence in a cell’s positioning.

    source("quantify_neighbourhood_function.R")

    # example usage
    calculate_neighbour_distance_for_all_cells(seu, reduction = "umap", colname = "neighbourhood_variance")

## Technique 3: Complementary reductions

The cell neighbourhoods can be explored across various dimensionality
reductions for insights.

For example, diffusion map and force-directed layout can provide clues
about cell development by preserving the continuous cell transitioning
trajectories.

## Example

Here we use 2 different PBMC datasets from SeuratData to demonstrate
usage.

    SeuratData::InstallData("ifnb")
    SeuratData::InstallData("pbmc3k")

    ifnb <- SeuratData::LoadData("ifnb")
    pbmc <- SeuratData::LoadData("pbmc3k")

    ifnb <- subset(ifnb, stim == 'CTRL')

The PBMCs are merged without integration and Run through a standard
pipeline to generate a nearest neighbour graph, clusters, and UMAP
reduction.

    seu <- merge(ifnb, pbmc)
    seu <- NormalizeData(seu)
    seu <- FindVariableFeatures(seu)
    seu <- ScaleData(seu)
    seu <- RunPCA(seu)

    seu <- FindNeighbors(seu, dims = 1:30, reduction = "pca")
    seu <- FindClusters(seu, resolution = 0.5)


    seu <- RunUMAP(seu, dims = 1:30, reduction = "pca")

    DimPlot(seu, group.by = c("orig.ident", "seurat_clusters"))
    FeaturePlot(seu, "CD3E")

Here the T cells are split into 2 clusters for the seperate datasets.

Using SC neighbours we can see that there is neighbourhood sharing
between the 2 seperate T cell clusters.

    visualize_neighbourhood(seu, meta_data_column = 'seurat_clusters', meta_data_highlight = 1, 'umap', density = T) +
    visualize_neighbourhood(seu, meta_data_column = 'seurat_clusters', meta_data_highlight = 1, 'umap', density = F)

    visualize_neighbourhood(seu, 'seurat_clusters', 2, density = T, percent = 90) +
    visualize_neighbourhood(seu, 'seurat_clusters', 2, density = F)

A heatmap showing all neighbourhood sharing of clusters can be generated
with visualise_neighbour_percentage.

    visualise_neighbour_percentage(seu = seu, graph = 'RNA_nn', meta_data_column = 'seurat_clusters')

Heatmap Example

For each cell we can calculate the percentage of cells from its
neighbours share the cells cluster (or other metadata column).

    seu <- calculate_outside_neighbours_cell(seu, 'seurat_clusters',colname = 'outside_neighbourhood')
    FeaturePlot(seu, outside_neighbourhood)

![Outside

Outside neighbours

Here we see can see the high percentage cells form the boundaries
between clusters, even when those boundaries don’t appear close together
on the UMAP.

For each cell we can calculate the variance in the distance to it it
neighbours based on a reductions embeddings. This can be useful to see
if there are any problems with your UMAP or there are some problamtic
cells in your dataset.

    seu <- calculate_neighbour_distance_for_all_cells(seu, reduction = 'umap', colname = 'neighbour_distance')
    FeaturePlot(seu, 'neighbour_distance')
