# calculate_neighbour_percentage

Calculates the percentage composition of cell types among the neighbours
of cells belonging to a specific group. Returns a data frame showing
what percentage of the neighbourhood belongs to each cell type.

## Usage

``` r
calculate_neighbour_percentage(
  seu,
  meta_data_column,
  meta_data_highlight,
  graph = "RNA_nn",
  reduction = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- seu:

  A Seurat object containing single-cell data with nearest-neighbour
  graphs stored in the graphs slot.

- meta_data_column:

  Name of the column in seu@meta.data to pull values from for grouping
  and analysis.

- meta_data_highlight:

  The specific value within meta_data_column to highlight and analyze
  neighbours for.

- graph:

  Name of the nearest-neighbour graph to use from seu@graphs (e.g.,
  "RNA_nn", "RNA_snn", or "SCT_nn").

## Value

A data frame with columns 'ids' (cell type labels), 'Freq' (count), and
'f' (percentage of total neighbours).
